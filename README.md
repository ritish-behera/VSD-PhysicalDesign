## Introduction
In the current scenario where using the commercial tools or software may feel expensive and difficult to master, the opensopurce EDA tools are trying to fill the gaps
to reach the mass of semiconducter enthusisat. Opensource tools are great way to learn the semiconducter fabrication flow starting from logic synthesis to chip tape out. Though as of now the optimizations of the tools and model libraries are not upto the mark as compared to commercial ones on performance basis, it is still useful for beginners and may turn out as a great deal in the future too.

  In this report, I have documented all my learnings as part of completion of "VSD-Physical design through opensource tools" workshop as well as tried to add a small contribution towards the community which could be useful for new learners to refer.

## Objective
The following workshop involved the complete RTL to GDSII design flow of a RISC-V procesor architecture considering all the steps from logic or RTL synthesis, static timing analysis, DFT to floorplan, placement, CTS, routing, physical verification as well as sign-off of the chip through the openLANE ASIC design flow.Skywater 130nm PDK is used for all the model libraries.

The openLANE ASIC design flow involves the following opensource tools for different processes-
1. YOSYS & ABC : Logic Synthesis
2. OpenSTA : Static Timing Analysis
3. FAULT : DFT
4. OpenROAD : Physical Design (FP, PP, Placement, Routing)
5. MAGIC & NETGEN : Physical Verification


# Module-1 : Inception of OpenSOurce EDA Tools and Skywater 130 nm PDK
 This module gave the foundation of the chip that has to be designed as well as introduced the OpenLANE ASIC design flow and SKywater 130 nm openPDK.

 The chip contained 48 pins with Quad Flat No-Leads (QFN) die package carrying an area of 7mm x 7mm. The SoC consisted of a CPU with GPIO bank which has to be designed on RISC-V ISA. Apart from this it included various foundry IPs such as PLL, SRAM, ADC & DAC all connected to the IO pads through the wire bonds for the functioning of the chip.
